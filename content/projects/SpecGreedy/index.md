Fast Spectral Theory-based Algorithms for unified dense subgraphs detection in large graphs.

<!--more-->

We propose and formulate the generalized densest subgraph detection problem (GenDS) and fast detection algorithms based on the graph spectral properties and greedy search, i.e., SPECGDS (SpecGreedy) and GEPGDS.

- *Theory & Correspondences*: The unified formulation, GenDS, subsumes many real problems from different applications; and its optimization is guaranteed by the spectral theory.
- *Scalable*: Propose fast and scalable algorithms to solve the unified detection problem over large graphs.
- *Effectiveness*: The performance (solution-quality and speedy) of SpecGreedy is verified on 40 real-world networks; and it can find some interesting patterns in real applications, like the sudden bursts in research co-authorship relationships.
