His research interests include:\ntrustworthy large foundation model technologies, addressing critical challenges such as knowledge editing, contextual faithfulness, and safe generation. methodologies for constructing and governing high-quality data, including big graph mining, approximation algorithms, graph compression, and summarization techniques. The arising of LLMs drives most of his interests to trustworthy foundation models, and graph LLMs which brings LLM the ability to understand grpahs, think and model with graphs. With graph LLMs, real world complex and combination problems can be well and trustworthily solved by AGI.
